	    			<p class="justified">I grew up in the small rural town of Boston, located in Western New York. Computers were not very big in our area; we had them, we just didn't know how to use them very well, so I had to do a lot of my learning on my own.  When I was 14, I got my first personal laptop for christmas, and since then, I fell in love.  I taught myself a few web languages: HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript, using YouTube tutorials and other websites.  It's amazing that there are more than just cat videos and memes on YouTube (haha).  That summer, I dove into Java.  It's hard to find a project to teach yourself a programming language, but luckily, I found a video game and plenty of opportunity: a widely popular single and multiplayer game called Minecraft.  </p>
